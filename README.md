IRCameraBulbController
======================
**IRCameraBulbController** is a simple Arduino based sytem to allow the control of a Nikon SLR using the IR remote port.  

There are two main components: The Arduino based hardware, and a software controller.

The Arduino code can be found in the `IRCameraBulbController` folder.

The Arduino can be controlled over serial using the commands documented in `IRCameraBulbController/README.md` but there is a .NET based Windows tool to simplify this.  An OSX controller is also planned.
